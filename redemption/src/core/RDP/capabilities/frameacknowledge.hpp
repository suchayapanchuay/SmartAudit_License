// 2.2.1.3 TS_FRAME_ACKNOWLEDGE_CAPABILITYSET
//===========================================

// The TS_FRAME_ACKNOWLEDGE_CAPABILITYSET structure advertises support for frame
// acknowledgment using the TS_FRAME_ACKNOWLEDGE_PDU (section 2.2.3.1) structure. This
// capability is sent by both the client and the server and is encapsulated in a server-to-client Demand
// Active PDU ([MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.13.1) or a client-to-server Confirm Active PDU ([MS-
// RDPBCGR] section 2.2.1.13.2).

// capabilitySetType (2 bytes): A 16-bit unsigned integer. The type of capability set. This field
//    MUST be set to CAPSETTYPE_FRAME_ACKNOWLEDGE (0x001E).

// lengthCapability (2 bytes): A 16-bit unsigned integer. The length, in bytes, of the capability
//    data.

// maxUnacknowledgedFrameCount (4 bytes): A 32-bit unsigned integer. When sent by the
//    server, it MAY be set to 0, in which case it simply advertises the server's ability to receive and
//    process the TS_FRAME_ACKNOWLEDGE_PDU (section 2.2.3.1). If it is not set to 0, it can be
//    used by the client as a hint that indicates the number of in-flight
//    TS_FRAME_ACKNOWLEDGE_PDUs that the server is prepared to accept. When sent by the
//    client, it provides a hint to the server as to how many in-flight frames the client can buffer.
//    Note that if the server chooses to have more in-flight frames than this number specifies, it is
//    possible that the client could be overloaded with frame data. The client MAY set this field to 0,
//    but this behavior SHOULD be avoided because it provides very little information to the server
//    other than that the client acknowledges frames.
