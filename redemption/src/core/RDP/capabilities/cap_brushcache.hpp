// 2.2.7.1.7 Brush Capability Set (TS_BRUSH_CAPABILITYSET)
// ======================================================
// The TS_BRUSH_CAPABILITYSET advertises client brush support. This capability is only sent from
// client to server.

// capabilitySetType (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The type of the capability set. This
//    field MUST be set to CAPSTYPE_BRUSH (15).

// lengthCapability (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The length in bytes of the capability
//    data, including the size of the capabilitySetType and lengthCapability fields.

// brushSupportLevel (4 bytes): A 32-bit, unsigned integer. The maximum brush level
//    supported by the client.
//    +-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
//    | BRUSH_DEFAULT     | Support for solid-color and monochrome pattern brushes with no caching.        |
//    | 0x00000000        | This is an RDP 4.0 implementation.                                             |
//    +-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
//    | BRUSH_COLOR_8x8   | Ability to handle color brushes (4-bit or 8-bit in RDP 5.0; RDP 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, |
//    | 0x00000001        | 6.1, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0 also support 16-bit and 24-bit) and caching. Brushes    |
//    |                   | are limited to 8-by-8 pixels.                                                  |
//    +-------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
//    | BRUSH_COLOR_FULL  | Ability to handle color brushes (4-bit or 8-bit in RDP 5.0; RDP 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, |
//    | 0x00000002        | 6.1, 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0 also support 16-bit and 24-bit) and caching. Brushes    |
//    |                   | can have arbitrary dimensions.                                                 |
