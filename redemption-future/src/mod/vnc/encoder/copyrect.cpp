// 7.6.2   CopyRect Encoding
// =========================

// The CopyRect (copy rectangle) encoding is a very simple and efficient encoding which can be used when the client
// already has the same pixel data elsewhere in its framebuffer. The encoding on the wire simply consists of an X,Y
// coordinate. This gives a position in the framebuffer from which the client can copy the rectangle of pixel data.
// This can be used in a variety of situations, the most obvious of which are when the user moves a window across the
// screen, and when the contents of a window are scrolled. A less obvious use is for optimising drawing of text or other
// epeating patterns. An intelligent server may be able to send a pattern explicitly only once, and knowing the previous
// position of the pattern in the framebuffer, send subsequent occurrences of the same pattern using the CopyRect encoding.
