// 2.2.7.2.4 Share Capability Set (TS_SHARE_CAPABILITYSET)
// ====================================================
// The TS_SHARE_CAPABILITYSET structure is used to advertise the channel ID of
// the sender and is fully specified in [T128] section 8.2.12. This capability
// is sent by both client and server.

// capabilitySetType (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The type of the
//    capability set. This field MUST be set to CAPSTYPE_SHARE (9).

// lengthCapability (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The length in bytes
//    of the capability data, including the size of the capabilitySetType and
//    lengthCapability fields.

// nodeId (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. This field SHOULD be set to 0
//    by the client and to the server channel ID by the server (0x03EA).

// pad2octets (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. Padding. Values in this
//    field MUST be ignored.
