// 2.2.1.1  Color Table Cache Capability Set (TS_COLORTABLE_CAPABILITYSET)

//    The TS_COLORTABLE_CAPABILITYSET structure is an unused capability set that advertises the size
//    of the color table cache used in conjunction with the Cache Color Table Secondary Drawing Order
//    (see section 2.2.2.2.1.2.4) and is based on the capability set in [T128] section 8.2.8. This capability
//    is sent by both client and server.

//    Instead of being specified by the Color Table Cache Capability Set, the existence of color table
//    caching is tied to support for the MemBlt (section 2.2.2.2.1.1.2.9) and Mem3Blt (section
//    2.2.2.2.1.1.2.10) Primary Drawing orders. If support for these orders is advertised in the Order
//    Capability Set (see [MS-RDPBCGR] section 2.2.7.1.3), the existence of a color table cache with
//    entries for six palettes is implied when palettized color is being used.

//     capabilitySetType (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The type of the capability set. This
//       field MUST be set to CAPSTYPE_COLORCACHE (0x000A).

//     lengthCapability (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The length, in bytes, of the capability
//       data, including the size of the capabilitySetType and lengthCapability fields.

//     colorTableCacheSize (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The number of entries in the color
//       table cache (each entry stores a color table). This value MUST be ignored during capability
//       exchange and is assumed to be 0x0006.

//     pad2octets (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer used as padding. Values in this field are
//       arbitrary and MUST be ignored.

    CAPLEN_COLORCACHE = 8
