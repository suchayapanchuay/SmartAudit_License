// 2.2.7.1.11   Sound Capability Set (TS_SOUND_CAPABILITYSET)

// The TS_SOUND_CAPABILITYSET structure advertises the ability to play a "beep" sound. This
// capability is sent only from client to server.

// capabilitySetType (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The type of the capability set. This
//    field MUST be set to CAPSTYPE_SOUND (12).

// lengthCapability (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The length in bytes of the capability
//    data, including the size of the capabilitySetType and lengthCapability fields.

// soundFlags (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. Support for sound options.
//   0x0001 SOUND_BEEPS_FLAG    Playing a beep sound is supported.
//   If the client advertises support for beeps, it MUST support the Play Sound PDU (section
//   2.2.9.1.1.5).

// pad2octetsA (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. Padding. Values in this field MUST be
//    ignored.
