// 2.2.7.1.5 Pointer Capability Set (TS_POINTER_CAPABILITYSET)

// The TS_POINTER_CAPABILITYSET structure advertises pointer cache sizes and
// flags and is based on the capability set specified in [T128] section 8.2.11.
// This capability is sent by both client and server.

// capabilitySetType (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The type of the
//    capability set. This field MUST be set to CAPSTYPE_POINTER (8).

// lengthCapability (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The length in bytes
//    of the capability data, including the size of the capabilitySetType and
//    lengthCapability fields.

// colorPointerFlag (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. Indicates support for
//    color pointers. Since RDP supports monochrome cursors by using Color Pointer
//    Updates and New Pointer Updates (sections 2.2.9.1.1.4.4 and 2.2.9.1.1.4.5
//    respectively), the value of this field is ignored and is always assumed to be
//    TRUE (at a minimum the Color Pointer Update MUST be supported by an RDP
//    client).
//    +---------------+-----------------------------------------+
//    | 0x0000 FALSE  | Monochrome mouse cursors are supported. |
//    +---------------+-----------------------------------------+
//    | 0x0001 TRUE   | Color mouse cursors are supported.      |
//    +---------------+-----------------------------------------+

// colorPointerCacheSize (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The number of
//    available slots in the 24 bpp color pointer cache used to store data received
//    in the Color Pointer Update (section 2.2.9.1.1.4.4).

// pointerCacheSize (2 bytes): A 16-bit, unsigned integer. The number of
//    available slots in the pointer cache used to store pointer data of arbitrary
//    bit depth received in the New Pointer Update (section 2.2.9.1.1.4.5).

//    If the value contained in this field is zero or the Pointer Capability Set
//    sent from the client does not include "his field, the server will not use
//    the New Pointer Update.
